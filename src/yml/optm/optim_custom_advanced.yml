# Advanced Optim Custom Configuration
# This shows more complex configurations for different extraction scenarios

# Example 1: Multi-field extraction with complex types
inputFields:
  - name: "document_text"
    field_type: "str"
    description: "Full document text to analyze"
    original_text: true
  - name: "document_type"
    field_type: "literal"
    literal_list: ["news", "research", "legal", "medical", "technical"]
    description: "Type of document being processed"
  - name: "extraction_focus"
    field_type: "str"
    description: "Specific focus area for extraction"

outputFields:
  - name: "key_entities"
    field_type: "list"
    description: "List of important entities mentioned in the document"
  - name: "sentiment_score"
    field_type: "float"
    range_min: -1.0
    range_max: 1.0
    description: "Overall sentiment score from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive)"
  - name: "summary"
    field_type: "str"
    description: "Brief summary of the document content"
  - name: "urgency_level"
    field_type: "literal"
    literal_list: ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]
    description: "Urgency level based on content analysis"
  - name: "relevant_dates"
    field_type: "list"
    description: "Important dates mentioned in the document"

# Example 2: Image-based extraction (requires image input)
# Uncomment below for image processing scenarios
# inputFields:
#   - name: "image"
#     field_type: "image"
#     description: "Image to analyze"
#   - name: "image_context"
#     field_type: "str"
#     description: "Context about what to look for in the image"

# outputFields:
#   - name: "objects_detected"
#     field_type: "list"
#     description: "List of objects detected in the image"
#   - name: "text_content"
#     field_type: "str"
#     description: "Any text content extracted from the image"

# Initial prompt for complex extraction
initial_prompt: |
  Analyze the provided content and extract structured information according to the specified requirements.
  
  Document Type: {document_type}
  Focus: {extraction_focus}
  Content: {document_text}
  
  Extract the following information:
  1. All key entities (people, organizations, locations, concepts)
  2. Overall sentiment (-1 to 1)
  3. A concise summary
  4. Urgency assessment
  5. Any relevant dates

# Dataset configuration
dataset: "data/advanced_extraction_dataset.csv"
save_dir: "results/advanced_optim_results"

# Optimization settings
task: "Extraction"
optim_burden: "heavy"  # Use heavy for complex extraction tasks
threads: 8  # Increase threads for faster processing
demos: 5  # More demos for complex tasks

# Extraction settings
multiple: true  # Enable multiple output extraction
recall_prior: true  # Prioritize finding all relevant information
ai_evaluation: true  # Use AI evaluation for complex scoring

# Advanced configuration notes:
# - Ensure your dataset has columns matching all input and output field names
# - For image processing, set up proper image handling in your dataset
# - Heavy optimization burden will take longer but produce better results
# - Multiple=true enables extraction of lists and complex structures

# extract_table_service Configuration File
# This file is used to configure parameters for table extraction service functionality

# Parsed file path
parsed_file_path: "D:/path/to/parsed/files"  # Replace with the folder path containing parsed files
  
# Result saving folder path
save_folder_path: "D:/path/to/save/results"  # Replace with the folder path to save extracted table results
  
# Output fields configuration (list of field names)
# === OUTPUT FIELDS ===
# Define what your model should extract or generate from the input
outputFields:
  - name: "public_datasets"
    field_type: "list"  # List of public dataset identifiers
    description: "Public datasets mentioned in the literature"
  - name: "non_public_datasets"
    field_type: "list"  # List of non-public dataset identifiers
    description: "Non-public datasets mentioned in the literature"
  - name: "databases"
    field_type: "list"  # List of database names/links

# Classification prompt
classify_prompt: "Please classify the table content"
  
# Extraction prompt
extract_prompt: "Please extract the data according to the specified fields"
  
# Number of threads to use for processing, default is 6
num_threads: 6
  
# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Set parsed_file_path to the folder path containing parsed files
# 2. Set save_folder_path to the folder path where extracted tables will be saved
# 3. Configure outputFields with the list of fields you want to extract
# 4. Set appropriate prompts for classification and extraction
# 5. If you want to extract directly without classification, set extract_directly to true
# 6. Adjust num_threads according to your system capabilities
# 7. If file encoding is not utf-8, you can modify the encoding parameter

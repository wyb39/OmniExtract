# YAML Configuration for Extraction tasks with optimization
# Copy this file and modify according to your needs

# === REQUIRED PATHS ===
# Directory containing the optimized settings and prompts from previous optimization
load_dir: "/data/tangbx/extraction/nc/optim_results"  # Path to optimization results directory

# Dataset to run predictions on
dataset: "/data/tangbx/extraction/nc/test_dataset.json"  # Path to the dataset file (JSON, CSV, TSV, or Excel format)

# Directory where prediction results will be saved
save_dir: "/data/tangbx/extraction/nc/pred_optimized_results"  

# === EVALUATION SETTINGS ===
# Evaluation mode: "confidence" (evaluate prediction confidence), "score" (evaluate prediction quality), or "" for no judgement
judging: ""

# === OUTPUT CONFIGURATION ===
# Output file name for the prediction results
output_file: "result.json"

# === USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ===
# 1. Ensure load_dir contains the optimization results:
#    - optim_settings.json (optimized PredictionSettings)
#    - optim_prompt.json (optimized prompts)
# 2. Replace dataset path with your actual dataset file path
# 3. Modify save_dir to your desired output directory
# 4. The endpoint will load optimized settings and prompts from load_dir
# 5. Predictions will be run on your dataset with the optimized configuration
